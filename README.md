# Runaway Button On the Loose...

## Intro
Extra, Extra, read all about it, a runaway button is on the loose.... Curious about how the mastermind that created the button got away with it? Try to make one yourself!

## Task
In the index.html, style.css and script.js files given to you, create a button that can't stay still. Each time you click on the button it's position should move to a new location on the page!

#### Step One
Let's start off by moving our button in a single direction. Write code in your script.js file that makes your button move down the same distance each time it is clicked on.

#### Step Two
Now that we've got our button moving down, try to make it movie diagonally. Think about what that means in terms of x and y direction movement.

#### Step Three
Finally, let's get our button REALLY moving and throw in some randomization. Every time you click your button it should go flying to a new **random** location on the page.

An example of what your final project should look like is below. Feel free to style your button however you want to!

## Not sure where to begin?
You'll want to start out in your HTML, before you can have a moving button, you need to have a button in the first place!

Once you've got a button on your page, looking the way you want it to, move into your script file. Think about how you can access your button element in your script, and how to make it react to a click event. You should ask yourself what about your button element you'll need to change in order to make it move...

<!-- Add something in about offset? Or absolute positioning?  -->
