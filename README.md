# Runaway Button On the Loose...

## Intro
Extra, Extra, read all about it, a runaway button is on the loose.... Curious about how the mastermind that created the button got away with it? Try to make one yourself!

## Task
In the index.html, style.css and script.js files given to you, create a button that can't stay still. Each time you click on the button it's position should move to a new location on the page!
<!-- Change these directions -->

#### Step One
Let's make out button move without trying to control it. Our first type of motion will be completely random. Write code in your script.js file that makes your button move to a random location each time it is clicked on. Think about how you would normally position your button at a location on the page and then consider how you might set those attributes in your code.

#### Step Two
Let's start off by moving our button in a single direction. Write code in your script.js file that makes your button move down the same distance each time it is clicked on.

#### Step Three
Now that we've got our button moving down, try to make it movie diagonally. Think about what that means in terms of x and y direction movement.

## Not sure where to begin?
You'll want to start out in your HTML, before you can have a moving button, you need to have a button in the first place!

Once you've got a button on your page, looking the way you want it to, move into your script file. Think about how you can access your button element in your script, and how to make it react to a click event. You should ask yourself what about your button element you'll need to change in order to make it move...
